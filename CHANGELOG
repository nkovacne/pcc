1.5.1
=====

- Critical fix for removing mails

1.5
===

- Now PCC notifies via e-mail about unbanned users, released and deleted e-mails 

1.4.2
=====

- Explicitly closing DB session when not needed anymore.
- Some fixes in the unban method.

1.4.1
=====

- Fix: Some organizations don't use the e-mail address as the user login itself. We'll use the 'sender' param instead of 'sasl_username' as the user "object" (logging, blocking, etc.). For that being used, we'll check if there's a sasl_username parameter to avoid logging non-relayed attempts.

1.4
===

- New parameter 'whitelistedips' in the 'policy' section to specify IPs or CIDR ranges of clients to whitelist, so they're never processed.

1.3
===

- Several funcional fixes
- Now a blocked user can be unblocked and their held mail be released (-ur) or deleted (-ud). This is only useful if the 'action' parameter is HOLD.
- New option -c: Cleanup of old database entries

1.2
===

- New parameter 'action' in the 'policy' section to specify what to do with blocked e-mails. It allows two possible values: REJECT or HOLD.
- Comments and documentation improved.

1.1
===

- New flag -l for listing currently blocked users
- Changed location of parameter 'notice' from section 'policy' to 'mail'
- Added two parameters to section 'mail': 'mailsrv' and 'mailport' to configure the parameters of the SMTP server whereby notifications to admins will be sent
- Enhanced example pcc.conf file (more examples to the 'dbcon' parameter)
- Fix to test whether all config parameters have been defined (all of them are mandatory)

1.0
===

- Initial release
